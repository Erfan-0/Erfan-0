# Hey! I'm Erfan 👋

Someone who believes they can create new things just by pressing a few keys

### 💥 BombSquad / Ballistica
- I run **BSBOX**, my little server from [Overclocked](https://github.com/Over3dge/overclocked)  
- Tinker with plugins, test random ideas, and sometimes it actually works  
- Always messing around and seeing what happens
  
### 🤖 Telegram Bots
- Build Telegram bots for fun, small experiments, or automations  
- Sometimes for sales, sometimes just because I can  

### 🐧 Linux & Terminal
- Love Linux, the terminal, and poking at stuff until it behaves  
- Terminal = my happy place

### ⚡ Random Experiments
- Web scraping, tiny automation, small coding experiments  
- Not everything works, and that's part of the fun for me
